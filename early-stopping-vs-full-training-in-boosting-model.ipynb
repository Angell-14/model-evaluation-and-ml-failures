Their strength comes from sequentially adding weak learners to correct previous mistakes. However, this same strength can easily lead to **overfitting** if the model is allowed to train for too many iterations.\n\nA common question faced by people is:\n\n> **Should we rely on early stopping or train boosting models for a fixed (full) number of iterations?**\n\nWhile full training might appear thorough, it can:\n- Overfit the training data\n- Increase training time unnecessarily\n- Reduce generalization on unseen data\n\nOn the other hand, early stopping introduces a validation-based stopping criterion, which may:\n- Improve generalization\n- Reduce computational cost\n- Prevent performance degradation after an optimal point\n\nThis case study aims to compare these two strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Case Study?\n\nEarly stopping is frequently mentioned in theory, but:\n- It is often treated as a default switch rather than a choice\n- Many beginners misuse it or ignore its assumptions\n- Interview discussions frequently ask *why* and *when* early stopping works\n\nIt is especially useful for understanding:\n- Bias–variance tradeoff\n- Learning curves in ensemble models\n- Practical model selection strategies\n\n---\n\n### What Is Early Stopping?\n\nEarly stopping is a regularization technique where training is halted when performance on a validation set stops improving for a predefined number of iterations (called patience).\n\nIn boosting models:\n- Each iteration adds a new weak learner\n- Training loss usually decreases monotonically\n- Validation loss often follows a U-shaped curve\n\nEarly stopping stops training at the point where:\n- Validation performance peaks\n- Further training would lead to overfitting\n\n---\n\n### Full Training in Boosting Models\n\nFull training refers to:\n- Training the model for a fixed number of estimators (e.g., 500 or 1000 trees)\n- No validation-based stopping criterion\n- Performance is evaluated only after training completes\n\nWhile this approach is simpler, it assumes:\n- The chosen number of estimators is optimal\n- Overfitting risk is minimal\n\nThese assumptions often do not hold in real-world datasets.\n\n---\n\n## Approach\n\nIn this case study, we will:\n\n1. Select a regression/classification dataset\n2. Train a boosting model with:\n   - Full training (fixed number of estimators)\n   - Early stopping using a validation set\n3. Track and compare:\n   - Training vs validation performance\n   - Generalization gap\n   - Training time\n4. Visualize learning curves\n5. Analyze trade-offs and draw practical conclusions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# LET'S DO IT!!!!\n![funny gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZDQ2M210OHJuMG8wczA1OWJsOHd1bWRicjJkYnEwNnE3eGdzZWFkNCZlcD12MV9zdGlja2Vyc19zZWFyY2gmY3Q9cw/lGhBlBMIN2XsEteTN3/giphy.gif)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Overview\n\nThis case study uses publicly available loan data from LendingClub (2007–2010). Each record represents a loan issued to a borrower along with their financial, credit, and behavioral information at the time of approval. From an investor’s perspective, the goal is to **predict whether a borrower will fully repay a loan**, enabling better risk assessment and decision-making.\n\nThis dataset is well-suited for boosting models because it contains mixed feature types, non-linear relationships, and real-world noise, making it prone to overfitting and ideal for studying early stopping.\n\n\n## Target Variable\n\nThe target variable is **`not.fully.paid`**:\n- `1` → Loan was **not fully paid** (default)\n- `0` → Loan was **fully paid**\n\nThis is a **binary classification problem**, where the objective is to estimate default risk.\n\n---\n\n#### Feature Summary\n\nKey features include:\n- **Credit & financial attributes**: `fico`, `int.rate`, `dti`, `annual.inc`\n- **Credit behavior**: `revol.util`, `inq.last.6mths`, `delinq.2yrs`, `pub.rec`\n- **Loan characteristics**: `purpose`, `installment`\n\nThese features introduce complex interactions that boosting models can effectively learn.\n\n---\n\n#### Why This Dataset for Early Stopping?\n\nBoosting models can easily overfit this dataset by learning noisy borrower patterns and rare default cases.  \nThis makes it ideal for comparing **full training with a fixed number of estimators** against **early stopping based on validation performance**, with differences that are both measurable and visually clear.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import kagglehub\n\n# Download latest version\npath = kagglehub.dataset_download(\"saramah/loan-data\")\n\nprint(\"Path to dataset files:\",

Observations\n\nThe learning curves show that training AUC increases steadily with additional boosting rounds, indicating that the model continues to fit the training data more closely.\n\nIn contrast, validation AUC improves only during the initial rounds and then plateaus, demonstrating that further boosting does not improve generalization. This divergence between training and validation performance is a clear indicator of overfitting.\n\nThe comparison table confirms this behavior numerically. While full training achieves near-perfect training AUC, it performs worse on validation and test sets. Early stopping significantly reduces the generalization gap, resulting in higher validation and test AUC despite lower training performance.\n\nOverall, early stopping selects a more optimal model complexity and leads to better real-world performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Final Wrap-Up\n\nThis case study explored the impact of **early stopping versus full training** in boosting models using a real-world loan default prediction task.\n\nThrough controlled experiments, we observed that training a boosting model for a fixed number of iterations led to severe overfitting. While the fully trained model achieved near-perfect performance on the training data, it failed to generalize well to validation and test sets.\n\nIntroducing early stopping fundamentally changed this behavior. By monitoring validation performance and halting training at the optimal point, the model avoided unnecessary complexity, reduced overfitting, and achieved higher validation and test AUC. Although training performance decreased, generalization improved—highlighting the trade-off between model fit and real-world performance.\n\nThe learning curves visually reinforced this finding: training performance continued to improve with additional trees, while validation performance plateaued early. Early stopping effectively identified this inflection point and selected a more appropriate model capacity.\n\nOverall, this study demonstrates that early stopping is not merely a training convenience, but a critical regularization technique for boosting models. In practical machine learning workflows, especially on noisy real-world datasets, early stopping should be treated as a default design choice rather than an optional optimization.","metadata":{}}]}
